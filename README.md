# skiing-puzzle
I wrote this as an excercise. This was put up on the website http://geeks.redmart.com/2015/01/07/skiing-in-singapore-a-coding-diversion/. All scripts and programs run in the commandline. I wrote the Python version first and based on it i wrote the others. 
The Python version creates a temporary file to store the computed results. The PHP file based version also creates a temporary file while the memory based version does all the processing in memory.
